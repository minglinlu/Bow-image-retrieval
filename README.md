1.extract key points and descriptors

2.generate BOWs for each image using SIFT detector and SIFT descriptors.

3.complete idf computation.

# steps to use
You need to install opencv and make sure the makefile is no problem.
And get the images set from http://wang.ist.psu.edu/~jwang/test1.tar, tar -zxvf to your local dir.
vi train.cpp and replace "/Users/lml/Desktop/image.orig/" to your local dir.

Then try `make`...
We can get 3 output files: train genBOW query

There are 3 steps to do now.

(1) `./train 1000`
    train the dictionary with k=1000
    
(2) `./genBOW /Users/lml/Desktop/image.orig/`
    generate the BOW Mat for every image, including the idf.

(3) `./query /Users/lml/Desktop/image.orig/999.jpg`
    Now, you can get the result in ./result.html, open result.html, you can get the rank result.
